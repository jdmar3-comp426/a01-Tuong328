            Many Greek myths have multiple versions, and the legend of Prometheus is no exception. The Greek poet, Hesiod, is commonly considered to be the first author to introduce the myth. According to this account, Prometheus tricks Zeus into accepting an inferior sacrifice from mortal men. This sacrifice sets the precedent that men could keep the meat of sacrificed animals and only leave the bones and fat for the gods. Zeus is enraged by Prometheusâ€™ antics, and he retaliates by robbing humans of fire. Undeterred, Prometheus recaptures fire for humanity. He does so, however, at a great cost, for Zeus punishes him by having him chained to a rock as an eagle torments him by consistently eating his immortal liver.
